- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SollyVR
- I'm currently working on porting TF2 maps to VRChat; from H++ to Blender/Unity. I am also working on my own assets and worlds and look forward to sharing them with the public.
- Iâ€™m currently still learning how to fully utilize various software to achieve this and hope you can be patient with me sucking.
